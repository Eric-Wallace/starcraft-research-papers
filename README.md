# Research Papers on Starcraft BW and Starcraft II

A list of papers and links referencing the game of Starcraft. This list is meant as a reference for researchers to get caught up on different past techniques used in this game.

## Background

With the recently released API from joint work of Blizzard and Deepmind, Starcraft II seems poised to become an exciting testbed for Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence research. Over the past 8 years, the original game, Starcraft: Brood War, has been used as a research platform through the BWAPI. In order for unexperienced researchers to properly transition to working on problems in Starcraft, they need to learn about past techniques in this field. That is the goal of this repository. 

As a note, there do exist differences between the Starcraft Brood War and Starcraft II. In order to reflect that I have put an indicator of which game each paper in published about.
